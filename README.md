# DataModeling_Building_Slowly_Changing_Dimensions-SCDs-
This project provides a complete Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) implementation for NBA player data using PostgreSQL. It is designed to track how player attributes—such as scoring_class and is_active—change over different seasons, and to maintain historical records in a structured SCD Type 2 format.
